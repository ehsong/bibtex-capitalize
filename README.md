# bibtex-capitalize
Originally forked from [jaeyk/bibtex-capitalize](https://github.com/jaeyk/bibtex-capitalize). Made changes to regex for personal use.

Depending on the `.bib` file your generator generate, you may need to change the regex in the `capitalize.ipynb` file. I made modifications because my `.bib` looks like this:


```
@article{hong2017trauma,\n
