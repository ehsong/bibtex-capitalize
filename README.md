# bibtex-capitalize
Originally forked from [jaeyk/bibtex-capitalize](https://github.com/jaeyk/bibtex-capitalize). Made changes to regex for personal use.

Depending on the `.bib` file your generator generate, you may need to change the regex in the `capitalize.ipynb` file. I made modifications because my `.bib` looks like this:

`
@article{jennings2005generations,
	Author = {Jennings, M Kent and Zhang, Ning},
	Date-Added = {2019-03-06 15:46:15 -0800},
	Date-Modified = {2019-03-06 15:46:15 -0800},
	Journal = {The Journal of Politics},
	Number = {4},
	Pages = {1164--1189},
	Publisher = {Cambridge University Press New York, USA},
	Title = {Generations, political status, and collective memories in the Chinese countryside},
